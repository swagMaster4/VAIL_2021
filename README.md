2/8/21: DAY 1!
I am very excited to learn how to know when we apply which kind of AI model to solve problems the most effectively. I also hope to learn more about acquiring data, cleaning and organizing it and udnerstanding which features are important to be considered. I also want to be able to apply the knowledge I learn to a VQE Quantum algorithm project soon!

2/9/21: DAY 2!

1) What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
Supervised learning requires a labeled data set that the model is trained on. Unsupervised learning works by identifying cluster patterns on unlabeled data.

2) Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.

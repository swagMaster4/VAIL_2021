2/8/21: DAY 1!
I am very excited to learn how to know when we apply which kind of AI model to solve problems the most effectively. I also hope to learn more about acquiring data, cleaning and organizing it and udnerstanding which features are important to be considered. I also want to be able to apply the knowledge I learn to a VQE Quantum algorithm project soon!
